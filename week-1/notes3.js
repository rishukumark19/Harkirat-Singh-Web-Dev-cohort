Classes
------------------
A class is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. 
It allows you to define the structure and behavior of objects in a reusable way.

key concepts:
1. Class Declaration
    -you define a class using the class keyword followed by the class name.
    
2. Constructor
    -A special method called constructor is used to initialize the object's properties when an instance of the class is created.
3. Methods
    -Classes can have methods, which are functions defined within the class that operate on the object's data.
4. Instantiation
    -You create instances (objects) of a class using the new keyword.
