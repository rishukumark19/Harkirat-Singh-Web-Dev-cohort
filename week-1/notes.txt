Javascript Foundation
----------------------
-Why languages?  - ram only understand 01 and coders write in any specific language(high level)  ,which then gets compiled into 01(every language has a compiler)
-Interpreted vs compiled languages
-Why JS >> Other languages in some use-cases
-Strict vs dynamic languages
-Single threaded nature of JS   - means , js can only use one core at a time , thats y its consider a bad language for a scalable system (cluster module - for make it use all core)
-Simple primitives in JS (number, strings, booleans)
-Complex primitives in JS (arrays, objects)
-Functions in Javascript
-Practise problem solving
-Callback functions, Event loop, callback queue, Asynchronous programming
-Callback hell and Promises
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


-JS is an interpreted language
C++ is a compiled language
Interpreted languages go line by line while executing, can partially run until an
error comes
-Browsers can only understand HTML/CSS/JS (not technically true)
Thanks to Node.js , Javascript can also be used for “Backend Development”


Static vs dynamic languages
---------------------------------
-------------benefits------------
more strict code | can move fast
                 |
                 |
                 |
Constructs :
------------
variable:let (changabel value) , const(cannot change value), var(least use)
Data type: sting , number,booleans
